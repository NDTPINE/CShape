A string is said to be a child of a another string if it can be formed by deleting 0 or more characters from the other string. Given two strings of equal length, what's the longest string that can be constructed such that it is a child of both?

For example, ABCD and ABDC have two children with maximum length 3, ABC and ABD. They can be formed by eliminating either the D or C from both strings. Note that we will not consider ABCD as a common child because we can't rearrange characters and ABCD <> ABDC.
